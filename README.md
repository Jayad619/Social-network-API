# Social-network-API

## User Story
AS A social media startup I want an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database,
so that my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data.

## Criteria:

Given a social network API:

● WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database.

● WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.

● WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database.

● WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list.
